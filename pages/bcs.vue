      <h2>Better Call Saul</h2>
      <h3>Premise from Wikipedia:</h3>
      <p>Better Call Saul is a spin-off of Breaking Bad, a popular crime drama television series that ran from 2008 to 2013.[9][10] It is primarily a prequel that focuses on Jimmy McGill, a former con artist aiming to gain respectability as a public defender, and chronicles his gradual transformation into his eventual Breaking Bad persona of Saul Goodman, the flamboyant criminal lawyer with ties to the drug cartel. A majority of the show takes place over the six-year period prior to the events of Breaking Bad, spanning from approximately 2002 to 2008.[11][12]</p>
      <h3>My opinion:</h3>
      <p>Better Call Saul was almost not what it ended up being. Vince Gilligan, the creator of Breaking Bad initially had plans
        for a short mini series for this show. A collection of 20 to 30 minutes episodes showing Saul and his clients in wacky 
        situations. Thankfull, this is the Better Call Saul that they ended up creating.

        A spinoff show about the goofy lawyer
        from Breaking Bad sounds like it may not work, especially not for a long dramatic character driven show. Better Call Saul
        is so high quality it puts Walter and Jesse's 99.1% meth purity to shame. The character arc of Jimmy Mcgill should be studied,
        and his fall to the dark side of Saul Goodman is something to behold. For me this show is better than Breaking Bad. The writing
        is perfect, the cinematography is majestic, the jokes are actually hillarious and the cast of characters are perhaps the best
        in TV history. This show is a much watch for anybody whose heart beats. Vince Gilligan built a rocketship with Breaking Bad, 
        then with Better Call Saul he built a rocketship that could jump dimensions and land on the sun.

      <h2>Attack on Titan</h2>
      <h3>Premise from Wikipedia:</h3>
      <p>After his hometown is destroyed and is traumatized, young Eren Jaeger vows to cleanse the earth of the giant humanoid Titans that have brought humanity to the brink of extinction. Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans.</p>
      
      <h3>My opinion:</h3>
      <p> Attack on Titan is one the most popular mangas and for good reason. It has sold over 140 million copies worldwide. The first chapter was released in 2009 and the world saw
        season one of the anime in 2013. The manga finished in 2021 and the anime 2 years later. The world of Attack on Titan is brutal, awful. Most of humanity was eaten by large 
        human like creatures called titans. The few remaining humans retreated behind 50 meter high walls to be protected by the titans. Humans would live like this for over 100 years and 
        some managed to find peace. Eren Jaeger is not one of those people. Eren yearns to head beyond the walls and explore all the sights the world has. His friend armin encourages his 
        curiosity with illegal books of the outside world while his adopted sister Mikasa promises to protect him at all costs. Eren sees his situation as nothing more than cattle and wants
        to join the Survey Corps. A legion of soldiers called scouts that travel beyond the walls and bring the fight to the titans, usually with very little to no success. One day, Eren's 
        world is forever changed as a titan 60 meters tall kicks a hole in the wall. Titans overrun his hometown and he is reminded how they are so oppressed by these creatures. 

        <br> </br> <br> </br>


        Attack on Titan stands on the pedestals of not just the most captivating animes ever, but anything put to television. Watching Eren and his friends grow stronger to push back these
        seamingly invincile and infinite titans is incredible. The soldiers use a device called 3d maneuvering gear. Gear they wear that uses gas, hooks and swords to fly around and slice the 
        neck of titans, which is their only weak spot. There is so much movement possible from this creation and every scene using it is beautiful, with great sound effects to go with it. 

        <br> </br><br> </br>


        There are three areas that Attack on Titan really hits the mark: Mysteries, plot twists and dramatic action set pieces. 

        <br> </br><br> </br>

        The mystery element is prevalent from the first episode to the very end of the series. Why are characters making the decisions they are making? Why do the titans eat humans simply
        for pleasure? Where do the titans even come from? Where did the colossal titan come from and will he appear again? All these are mysteries from the first episode. There are a thousand
        more that will compel you to keep your eyes glued to the screen.

        <br> </br><br> </br>

        The plot twists come with answers to mysteries and more. Some twists will have you slightly shocked while some will have your jaw through the floor and 3 feet past the foundation of your
        house. Every plot twist seems like it comes out of nowhere, but when you rewatch you can find clues that were pointing to every single one. You will start by loving certain characters,
        then coming to hate them, to understanding why they comitted everything they did and in the end feeling sorry for them.

        <br> </br><br> </br>

        The action set pieces are beyond stellar. Some such as "Battle of Shiganshina District" and "Battle of Heaven and Earth" take up entire seasons. The Battle of Shiganshina District is 
        in my opinion the most intense and dramatic 8 episodes in TV history. Our heroes and enemies confront one another where winner take all. We see our heroes put in a situation where it
        seems they have zero hope of seeing victory yet they still strategize and fight their oppressors, and at the end of the battle when it seems all is finally over, they must make an
        emotional and heartbreaking choice that alters the rest of the story.

        <br> </br><br> </br>

        A story of human hate, war and love. You will see the lengths that your favourite and most hated characters have to go to to protect their loved ones in this incredibly cruel world,
        where it seems like there will never be any hope for peace. Eren Jaeger as a main character is up there will Walter White with an all-time character arc. He continues to push forward
        until he will be able to taste true freedom, figure out the mystery of this world and travel past his cage and gaze upon the blue sea with his own two eyes.

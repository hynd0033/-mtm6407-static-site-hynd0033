    <h2>Daredevil</h2>
    <h3>Premise from Wikipedia:</h3>
    <p>The first season sees lawyer-by-day Matt Murdock use his heightened senses from being blinded as a young boy to fight crime at night on the streets of New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood as Daredevil while uncovering a conspiracy of the criminal underworld being led by Wilson Fisk.</p>
    <h3>My opinion:</h3>
    <p>I have seen the Daredevil show about 4 times now. I've watched it from the beginning when it was a Netflix show and not a Disney+ property.
      Each time I see it, I like it even more than the last. Matt Murdock is a very interesting character. 
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
      He struggles with his mission to fight crime without just slaughtering criminals, which
      he is very capable of doing. We see mob bosses he puts away come back and blackmail the entire FBI. Having him grapple with having to either kill the Kingpin or hope the justice system
      can somehow work against such a powerful man who has corrupted so many.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Daredevil's powers are unique. Being blind but being able to "see" with his other senses gives the writers plenty of creativity on situations to put him in. Daredevil is a very good show, and
      I am reluctant to watch the fourth season coming from Disney as i'm not sure they can recapture what they once did.

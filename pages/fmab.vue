      <h2>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</h2>
      <h3>Premise from Wikipedia:</h3>
      <p>Set in the early 20th century, in a fictional universe in which alchemy is a widely practiced science, the series follows the journey of two alchemist brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who are searching for the philosopher's stone to restore their bodies after a failed attempt to bring their mother back to life</p>
      <h3>My opinion:</h3>
      <p> Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a consistently good show. The world is fleshed out and makes sense. You will come to understand the rules of the science of alchemy, how it affects
        the people and the political landscape. The power of alchemy has defnied rules that are followed throughout the show giving some truth to this fictional world. It isn't used in the most 
        creative ways ever but it serves it's purpose perfectly.

        <br> </br><br> </br>

        The story of the Alphonse brother's is tragic. You want to see them suceed and move through their horrible situation. You feel for the loss they've suffered from the dissaperance of 
        their father, the death of their mother and their attempt to bring her back. It doesn't have the largest plot twists of these 5 shows but in turn it won't have you needing to google
        what just happened in an episode. At 64 episodes, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood provides plenty of substance without overstaying its welcome. The 2003 version is a solid show too. It
        takes a different approach to the story as the anime was being made faster than the manga could be written.
        
        <br> </br><br> </br>

        Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a show about giving and taking. This show will give you a well crafted
        story with interesting characters, action packed fight scenes and a beatiful soundtrack. What you decide to take from it is up to you.
